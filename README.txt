Open Concordance aims to be an easy to use concordance software and text and corpus analysis tool. It could be described as an Open Source alternative to Lawrence Anthony's Antconc.

Requirements

Open Concordance is written in Python 3. If you do not already have it, you can download it for free at http://www.python.org/.

Running the program

The code is obviously at an early stage, so some things will have to be hardcoded by you if you wish to make it work. First, the folder containing your corpus should be in the same folder as the program. By default the program will look for a folder named "txts" and load all .txt files found in it. 
Please make sure your folder only contains .txt files.
